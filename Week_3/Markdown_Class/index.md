I really like using markdown.

I think I'll use it. This is an example of a markdown paragraph. Use two lines between text to define paragraphs.

Headings--

# heading 1
## heading 2
### heading 3


**bold**

_italics_

**_bold and italics_**

This is an ordered list

1. item one
2. item two
3. item three
4. item four

this is an unordered list

- item one
- item two
- item three
- item four
