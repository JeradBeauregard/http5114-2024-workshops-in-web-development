I really like using markdown.

I think I'll use it. This is an example of a markdown paragraph. Use two lines between text to define paragraphs.

Headings--

# heading 1
## heading 2
### heading 3


**bold**

_italics_

**_bold and italics_**

This is an ordered list

1. item one
2. item two
3. item three
4. item four

this is an unordered list

- item one
- item two
- item three
- item four

## images

## code

We can put inline code using a tic.

to add an image use `<img>` tag. use tic top left of keyboard not quotes
use three tics for multi-line code


include language next to intro tics for multi-line code, may have to look up language name. will colour code when working

```javascript
function test(){
    console.log("test");
}
```

## tables

| Language | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| HTML     |   5    |
| CSS      |   9    |
|JavaScript|   7    |
